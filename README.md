# python-challenge
This project uses Python to automate data analysis for two real-world scenarios: financial data in the PyBank challenge and election results in the PyPoll challenge. In the PyBank challenge, the script calculates key financial metrics, including the total number of months, net profit or loss, average monthly change, and the greatest increases or decreases in profits. These results are output to both the console and a text file. In the PyPoll challenge, the script processes election data to calculate the total votes, the number and percentage of votes for each candidate, and identifies the winner based on the popular vote. The results are also saved to a text file. Both scripts replace manual analysis, making the process quicker and more accurate by automating calculations and providing clear, reliable insights.
